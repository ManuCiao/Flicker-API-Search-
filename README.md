# Flicker API Search
<hr>

This is an example of a web page that uses AJAX to search Flickr for pictures of any tags the user will type in the input box. It will then display thumbnails of the pictures corrisponding to the searched tag on the page and link to their Flickr photo page.

## How to Use it 
To run the code download the project and open the *index.html* with your favourite browser.

Type any tag on the input box and click Search. A bunch of pictures stored in Flicker corrisponding with the tag you typed in will appear on the web page.
